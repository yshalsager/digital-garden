# 1 Intro & Overview of Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults  
  
- Pipeline: action oriented process flow  
- Pillar: organizational category across the pipelines and vaults  
- Vault: knowledge management  
- Cycle: periodic review to keep things going in the right direction  
  
# 3 Systems Thinking  
  
## System  
  
- Defined by its function in larger systems  
- if divided into its components it can't function  
- its function is derived from interactions of its parts  
- how to look at it? In its entirety and how it functions in greater systems  
- part of larger systems  
  
## Analytical Thinking  
  
studies the components of a system and integrates them into an understanding of the whole.  
**Con**:  
  
- The system loses its essential properties.  
- it doesn't show how the system fits into the larger system.  
- it isn't possible to understand complex things this way.  
- leaves us with obvious explanations  
  
## Systems Thinking:  
  
looking at the world as interconnected ecosystems orbiting and interacting with each other.  
  
- looks at: patterns, not elements  
- reveals insights and shows similar, repeating fractal patterns (both micro and macro across disciplines)  
- reveals properties and causal relationships in systems that don't exist in their components  
  
## Emergence  
  
Happens when new qualities form in a system, beyond its components' core properties  
  
- Example 3  
  - life  
  - consciousness  
  - water  
- recognizing it is a cornerstone of - - Systems Thinking  
  
## Process 6 steps of Systems Thinking  
  
1. define inputs, outputs and movements  
2. distinguish linear from circular  
3. look for patterns  
4. find the feedback loops (anything with exponential growth has a feedback loop)  
5. understand the balancing processes (these keep the system in equilibrium)  
6. study the system's interactions with other systems  
  
# 4 Notion Design with Systems Thinking Approach  
  
- define inputs, outputs and movements  
  - write out how information will flow through the system and optimize.  
  - where are the likely bottlenecks? anticipate them and design for that.  
    - what happens with the backup pool that accumulates at the bottlenecks?  
  - how does the system pause or reset when things go sideways?  
- look for reoccurring patterns  
  - reflect on the circular patterns in your life that you want to enhance with notion  
  - what do you want to do less of and more of?  
  - what are you doing over and over?  
  - identify what notion can improve and obtain clarity what needs to be implemented  
  - make lists of these by category on a kanban board  
  - better yet, lay out the process in a flowchart (whimsical, miro).  
- find and cultivate feedback loops  
  - design the system to facilitate feedback loops  
  - what activities will get you closer to your goals?  
  - feedback loops will put you on an exponential improvement curve  
  - how can the system shape your activities to generate compounding results?  
  - how can you combine complementary pieces of knowledge to create something more powerful?  
  - creativity is mostly about combining disparate ideas into new combinations  
  - a well-designed system will create - - Emergence  
- add balancing processes  
  - use periodic reviews to keep the system in equilibrium  
- study the system's interactions with other systems  
  - study this inside and outside notion  
  - identify entry and exit points and how patterns and feedback loops overlap and magnify across systems  
  - patterns in one system echo in other related systems  
  - think and design holistically  
  
# 5 Life Operating System Overview  
  
- objectives of the system  
  - **Transparency**: what's progressing as planned and what's stuck  
  - **Prioritization**: what matters most in what order  
  - **Focus**: when sitting down to work, have everything needed and nothing distracting  
- **Focus Area**: contains the most important parts of the system and aligns how time is spent with ultimate objectives  
  - how does it relate to the Business and Home/Life sections? has their priority actions and goals  
- **Growth Area**: for personal enhancement  
- **Dashboards**: they contain the most important and used elements from PPVs  
- **Action Zone**: for organizing tasks  
- avoid having more than 3 work priorities/day  
- when adding a task with a priority listing, define projects, pillars and goal outcomes  
  - **Caution** if you can't define these, either the task shouldn't be added or you haven't defined your projects, pillars or goal outcomes properly  
- **Pillar Pipeline Pyramid**: links daily activities to the bigger vision  
  - top is narrow with focus and bottom is broad with more items  
  - Guiding Principles: define direction, values  
  - **Life Pillars**:  
    - annual reviews and plan for the next year  
    - quarterly and monthly reviews  
    - milestones: accomplishments and disappointments (this creates more transparency than just memories)  
    - pillars: pillars connected to the things beneath them in the pyramid.  
  - **Goal Pipeline**:  
    - Value Goals: aspirations in an emotional way (tied to pillars)  
    - Goal Outcomes: measurable incarnations of value goals (tied to value goals)  
- **Execution Pipelines**:  
  - Projects: specific things that advance us toward the goal outcomes or support the pillars  
  - Action Items: action steps of projects  
- week/month/quarter review  
  - at the beginning of the week, define the focus and objectives  
  - at the end of the week, do the weekly review  
- growth  
  - Mindset & Identity Sculpting: building towards the person you aspire to be  
  - Fitness: workout tracker  
  - Habits & Routines  
    - review them in the monthly review  
  - Mind Expansion  
    - The Library: book reading tracker and book notes  
    - Media Vault: links to articles, videos, social media posts and podcasts  
    - Academy: course documentation and notes  
    - Research Workspaces: active interest areas that are broader than a specific project  
      - aggregates different learnings across books, media, courses and conversations  
- **Process building the system:**  
- Command Center with placeholders, so you know what you are building towards  
- Task Database  
- Action Zone  
- Pillar Pipeline Pyramid  
- Reviews  
- Growth  
- Business  
- Home/Life  
  
# 8 Task Database  
  
- the tasks of the Calendar view are organized by do date  
- any item with a time has the scheduled priority, the rest of the items are sorted by priority  
- priorities in order  
  - **Immediate**: must do it first that day  
  - **Quick**: takes less than 5 minutes  
  - **Scheduled**: for scheduled tasks  
  - **1st-5th Priority**: if you do items in a batch, assign them the same priority  
  - **Errand**: for errands  
  - **Remember**: do it, if time permits  
- if items are piling up on a day, schedule them out to future dates  
- the night before every day, lay out the schedule of the next day  
- you can lay out large blocks on the calendar  
- master table view  
  - filtered by "Done Is Not"  
  - everything has a do date, except dependent tasks  
  - when the master task has been completed, the dependent task activates and gets a do date  
  - prioritization  
    - it's much easier to rank the priority of a small number of items  
    - if it's urgent, it should be scheduled for today or tomorrow  
    - if it's not urgent, just give it a date then rank it the day before or reassign it to another day  
  - sorted by  
    - 1 Do Date/Descending  
    - 2 Priority/Ascending  
  - ask for each item: is there a goal outcome of a project that this is driving towards completion on?  
  - Process adding a new task  
  - Priority  
  - Do Date: when you want to do it  
  - Note  
  - Client  
  - Due Date: external, fixed deadline  
  - Projects: related project if applicable  
  - Pillars: related pillar  
  - Goal Outcomes: measurable outcomes  
  - Production Pipeline: related to content creation pipeline  
  - Waiting: check if waiting for someone  
  - Owner: to who it is assigned  
  # 9 Dependent Tasks  
  - the Dependent Tasks view is filtered by "Following Is not empty"  
  - the Following column has the task which the dependent task depends on  
  - the Next In Line column has the task which is after the dependent task  
  - when you set a dependent task as done, go to the next in line task and assign its do date and tentative priority  
  - the + in the task name means there is a task next in line  
  - dependent tasks ensure that when you change the do date of the first task, the rest will adjust  
  - remove the do date of the dependent task after setting up a dependency  
  - if the dependent tasks are sorted incorrectly, sort them manually  
  # 10 Daily Data Tracking  
  - you can export the CSV of the data monthly to a spreadsheet app and graph or chart it  
  - add a separate icon for every week  
  - properties  
    - Diet: diet quality on a scale of 5  
    - Habits: check after it's done  
    - On Schedule: percent of time spent on schedule  
    - Output: achieved results relative to planned  
    - Improvements: what you can do better to achieve more from the day  
    - Planning Review: add the reviews when they are done  
  - the current week has << after it  
  # 11 Action Zone  
  - Not To Do List: list of most common distractions and mistakes  
  - the habits of the Daily Tracking table should be in sequential order  
  - if somebody is taking too long in the Waiting On table, assign a do date with quick priority to follow up and uncheck waiting  
  - Ongoing Low Priority List: things to do if time permits  
  # 12 Task Status Enhancement  
  - Status property  
    - Active  
    - Waiting: waiting for someone  
    - Paused: started it, but it got paused for some reason  
    - Next Up: next task in the queue  
    - Future: task after Next Up  
  - when setting up a project, think about every involved task and  
    - add tasks for the next 1-2 weeks as Active  
    - add non-dependent, tentative tasks as Next Up or Future  
  - the bottom of the task list has tasks that you don't want to assign do dates to yet, but got added when setting up projects  
  - the status of dependent tasks is always active  
  - review the Non-Active Review table in the weekly review to see if there is anything that needs to be changed to Active.  
  # 13 Flow Chart  
  - Flowchart: visualizes how information, data and assets flow through the system  
  - put incoming media which might be useful later into evernote and move it to Media Resources when it becomes relevant to a project  
  # 14 Quick Entry Notes & Tasks  
  - quick entry has too high backend costs  
  - setting the filter to "Do Date Is on or before Today" automatically populates the Do Date field when adding a new task  
  - add new tasks quickly by filling only their title, tentative priority and do date  
  - add shortcuts to pages on iOS: open it in safari and add it to the homescreen  
  # 15 Task Lists & Do Dates  
  - if a task is important, it should have a do date. this ensures that it gets deliberate consideration.  
  - if you keep reassigning a task into the future, 05be you should delete it  
  - the initial priority of a task might not hold up after some reflection or events  
  - when adding a new task, ask  
    - what matters now  
    - will it move you towards your higher priorities?  
    - will it have the biggest impact on where you want go?  
    - will it remove something blocking you?  
  - add toggles to the Ongoing Low Priority List to organize it if it gets too big, reorganize it in the weekly review  
  - if you have a task you might want to do, add it quickly  
  - Process if you keep pushing a project with scheduled tasks back  
    1. move the tasks out of the task database  
    2. keep them attached to the project  
    3. put the project on hold  
    4. when you activate the project, the tasks become live again  
  # 16 Alignment Zone
