- Node is very popular and increasingly chosen for doing major tasks.  
- Used all along the web back-end stack.  
- Useful for command-line scripts and tools.  
- Node.js uses an event-driven non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](./JavaScript%20NPM.md), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.  
  - Non-blocking I/O can continue to process code while waiting for requests.  
    - It's originally built in the browser and got brought out to be a critical feature of Node.  
- NPM is an enormous database of open source packages
