We can also destructure the properties in the object like we can do in [[./, JavaScript Array Destructuring|Array Destructuring]].

## Simple Object Destructuring

We can destructure with the use of `{}` in a `const` variable, similar to how we use it to create an object.

We then reference to the object itself with the \-``js
const { name, openingHours, categories } = restaurant; // restaurant is an object
console.log(name, openingHours, categories); // return values of the properties name, openingHours and categories
```

## Referencing Same Properties but Use Different Name

- We can use this example to rename the properties in the object.
- This is very useful when we are working with third-party APIs and requiring to extract values with unknown variable names.

```js
// property: variableName
const { name: restaurantName, openingHours: hours, categories: tags } = restaurant;
console.log(restaurantName, hours, tags);
```

## Dealing With Non-explicitly Defined Data Using Default Values

- Often when dealing with non-explicit defined data, we may find this method useful to give **default values** to create empty properties.
- This would be useful because we would have **zero** clue on the amount of data that we are receiving.

```js
const { menu = [], starterMenu: starters = [] } = restaurant;
console.log(menu, starters); // will return an empty menu array + starterMenu array redefined as starters
```

This is useful for creating your **own** array from an API response etc.

## How Can We Mutate Variables In an Object?

Where the variables in the object needs to be **redefined**, we can mutate it within the object itself by **destructuring** its contents.

We can use the simple method of destructuring an array, as seen in [[./, JavaScript Array Destructuring|Array Destructuring]].

```js
let a = 111;
let b = 999;
const obj = { a: 23, b: 7, c: 14 };
// If were to log
console.log(a, b); // This will return the value of 111 999, not 23 and 7
// To solve this, we can reassign the obj object

// {a, b} = obj // This won't work, because { is used to define a code block so we need to wrap the line in parenthesis ()
({ a, b } = obj);
console.log(a, b); // This will return the value of 23, 7 as declared in the obj object earler.
```

## Obtaining Variables In a Nested Object

While we can use a simple `const { property } = objectName` to get the objects, we can also instead use a nested function within the declaration above to get the value of the variable itself.

```js
const {
  property: { item1, item2 },
} = objectName;
console.log(item1, item2); // will return the EXACT variable in the objectName obj.
// Setting variable name
const {
  property: { item1: one, item2: two },
} = objectName;
console.log(one, two);
```

## Dealing With Methods (functions In Objects) With Multiple Args

- It can be difficult to track the order of which the arguments of a function should be written.
- This method of having objects into function arguments is very common in many JavaScript libraries.
- It is useful because the main object method does the destructuring for you instead.
- This way the order of argument is optional, it doesn't need to be the same.

```js
const restaurant = {
  name: 'Classico Italiano',
  location: 'Via Angelo Tavanti 23, Firenze, Italy',
  categories: ['Italian', 'Pizzeria', 'Vegetarian', 'Organic'],
  starterMenu: ['Focaccia', 'Bruschetta', 'Garlic Bread', 'Caprese Salad'],
  mainMenu: ['Pizza', 'Pasta', 'Risotto'],
  // A method that destructures the passed object argument directly to variables with same names as object keys, and still it can has default values.
  orderDelivery({ starterIndex = 1, mainIndex = 0, time = '20:00', address }) {
    console.log(
      `Order received! ${this.starterMenu[starterIndex]} and ${this.mainMenu[mainIndex]} will be delivered to ${address} at ${time}`
    );
  },
}

// Calling the method and passing object to the function
restaurant.orderDelivery ({
  time: '22:30',
  address; 'Via del Sole, 21',
  mainIndex: 2,
  starterIndex: 2,
});
```
