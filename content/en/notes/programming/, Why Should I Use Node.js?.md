- Node is very popular and increasingly chosen for doing major tasks.
- Used all along the web back-end stack.
- Useful for command-line scripts and tools.
- Node.js uses an event-driven non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [[./, JavaScript NPM|npm]], is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
  - Non-blocking I/O can continue to process code while waiting for requests.
    - It's originally built in the browser and got brought out to be a critical feature of Node.
- NPM is an enormous database of open source packages
