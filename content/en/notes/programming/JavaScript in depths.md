## 1. High Level Language  
  
What this means is that JavaScript is a language that does not require you to manage the computer's resources such as memory management.  
  
## 2. Garbage Collected  
  
This happens through this process known as garbage collection. This process removes and stops any unnecessary applications from running in the background.  
  
## 3. Interpreted or just-in-time compiled  
  
What this means is that it is a very fast programming language that deals with abstracting on top machine code (binary). This is handled directly via the JS engine.  
  
## 4. Multi-paradigm  
  
An approach or mindset when it comes to structuring the code. JavaScript can use any of these three types of programming!  
  
1. Procedural programming  
2. Object-oriented programming  
3. Functional programming  
  
## 5. Prototype-based object-oriented  
  
This prototype-based allows us to have inheritance to other elements.  
  
## 6. First-class Functions  
  
This means that functions are treated as variables. This means that we can run functions within functions and return function value.  
  
## 7. Dynamic  
  
We do not assign data type to variables. This means that data variables are automatically changed when it is running through the runtime.  
  
## 8. Single-threaded  
  
- The concurrency model demonstrates how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks. As JavaScript is a single-threaded approach where it can only do one thing at a time.  
- This means that a long piece of code will result in a blocking.  
  
## 9. Non-blocking event loop  
  
A non-blocking loop allows us to take long running tasks and run them in the background, later putting it into the main thread in the future once they are finished.
