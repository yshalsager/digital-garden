## Lesson 07: [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView)  
  
> Everything is better in a list! Recycler View has been - and continues to be - an essential component of any app design. This lesson is all about making your [app](https://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-sleep-tracker-with-recyclerview) better with Recycler Views.  
  
### [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView)  
  
Displaying a list or grid of data is one of the most common UI tasks in Android. Lists vary from simple to very complex. A list of text views might show simple data, such as a shopping list. A complex list, such as an annotated list of vacation destinations, might show the user many details inside a scrolling grid with headers.  
  
To support all these use cases, Android provides the `RecyclerView` widget.  
  
* `RecyclerView` is designed to be efficient even when displaying extremely large lists. It allows you to build everything from simple lists of `TextViews` all the way to very complex collections of views.  
* It only support displaying different types of items in the same list. For example, a news app may want to mix video items into a list of headlines.  
* `RecyclerView` is also highly customizable. Out-of-the-box, it supports lists and grids. You can configure it to scroll horizontally or vertically. If the default options aren't enough, you can even build your own layout manager to make `RecyclerView` display any design you dream up.  
  
**Advantages of RecyclerView**  
* Efficient display of large list.  
* Minimizing refreshes when an item is updated, deleted, or added to the list.  
* Reusing views that scroll off screen to display the next item that scrolls on screen.  
* Displaying items in a list or a grid.  
* Scrolling vertically or horizontally.  
* Allowing custom layouts when a list or a grid is not enough for the use case.  
  
The greatest benefit of `RecyclerView` is that it is very efficient for large lists:  
  
* By default, `RecyclerView` only does work to process or draw items that are currently visible on the screen. For example, if your list has a thousand elements but only 10 elements are visible, `RecyclerView` does only enough work to draw 10 items on the screen. When the user scrolls, `RecyclerView` figures out what new items should be on the screen and does just enough work to display those items.  
* When an item scrolls off the screen, the item's views are recycled. That means the item is filled with new content that scrolls onto the screen. This `RecyclerView` behavior saves a lot of processing time and helps lists scroll fluidly.  
* When an item changes, instead of redrawing the entire list, `RecyclerView` can update that one item. This is a huge efficiency gain when displaying lists of complex items!  
  
In the sequence shown below, you can see that one view has been filled with data, `ABC`. After that view scrolls off the screen, `RecyclerView` reuses the view for new data, `XYZ`.

#### Other options  
  
`RecyclerView`, while efficient and customizable, is not the only way to display a list of things on Androids.  
Android also ships with a few other options for displaying lists.  
* The first are `ListView` and `GridView` for displaying a scrolling list and grid respectively. You can think of this as `RecyclerView` simpler, but less powerful siblings. Both of them work for displaying a small list of items that aren't too complex, like 100 items. They are not nearly as efficient as `RecyclerView`, and they don't offer nearly as many options for customizing the display.  
* The other option is `LinearLayout`. You've already seen that earlier linear layout can be used to display a small list of items, for example three to five.

### Your first RecyclerView  
  
#### The adapter pattern  
  
If you ever travel between countries that use different electric sockets, you probably know how you can plug your devices into outlets by using an adapter. The adapter lets you convert one type of plug to another, which is really converting one interface into another.  
  
The [adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) in software engineering helps an object to work with another API. `RecyclerView` uses an adapter to transform app data into something the `RecyclerView` can display, without changing how the app stores and processes the data. For the sleep-tracker app, you build an adapter that adapts data from the `Room` database into something that `RecyclerView` knows how to display, without changing the `ViewModel`.  
  
#### [Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter) Interface  
  
`RecyclerView` adapters must provide a few methods for `RecyclerView` to understand how to display the data on screen.  
  
* First, in order to know how far to scroll, the adapter needs to tell the recycler view **how many items** are available.  
* Then you provide **a way for the RecyclerView to draw a specific item**. `RecyclerView` we'll use this anytime an item enters the screen or if you update or add an item that's churned on the screen.  
* Finally, you must provide `RecyclerView` with **a way to create a new view for an item**. This is important because while recycler view is responsible for handling the recycling and efficient display of the views, it has no idea what kind of views you would like to display.  
  
#### How does RecyclerView works?  
  
* When `RecyclerView` runs, it will use the adapter to figure out how to display your data on screen.  
* When it first starts out, it will ask the adapter how many items there are. If the adapter set there is 100, it will immediately start creating just the views needed for the first screen.  
* First, recycler view will ask the adapter to create a new view for the first data item in your list.  
* Once it has the view, it will ask the adapter to draw the item. It will repeat this until it doesn't need any more views to fill the screen.  
* Then your `RecyclerView` is done. It won't look at the other items in the list until the user scrolls to list on screen.  
* If it's items go off the screen, they will be reused or recycled in the next position that gets displayed.  
* When recycling, `RecyclerView` doesn't need to create a view. It will just use the old one and ask the adapter how to draw the next item into it.  
  
#### [ViewHolder](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html)  
  
To implement recycling and support multiple types of views, `RecyclerView` doesn't interact it to views but instead `ViewHolders`. This is the last part of the adapter interface.  
  
* `ViewHolders` do exactly what it sounds like they do, **hold views**. They also had a lot of extra information that `RecyclerView` uses to efficiently move views around the screen.  
* `ViewsHolders` know things like the last position the items have in the list, which is important when you are animating list changes. In other words, **storing information for RecyclerView**.  
* `ViewHolders` really don't do that much, and they're mostly an implementation detail of the `RecyclerView`. Your adapter will take care of providing any `ViewHolders` that the `RecyclerView` needs.  
  
#### Implementing a RecyclerView  
  
To display your data in a `RecyclerView`, you need the following parts:  
  
* **Data** to display.  
* **A [`RecyclerView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView)** instance defined in your layout file, to act as the container for the views.  
* **A layout for one item of data**.   
 If all the list items look the same, you can use the same layout for all of them, but that is not mandatory. The item layout has to be created separately from the fragment's layout, so that one item view at a time can be created and filled with data.  
* **A [layout manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.LayoutManager)**.  
 A `RecyclerView` uses a `LayoutManager` to organize the layout of the items in the `RecyclerView`, such as laying them out in a grid or in a linear list. In the `<RecyclerView>` in the layout file, set the `app:layoutManager` attribute to the layout manager (such as `LinearLayoutManager` or `GridLayoutManager`). You can also set the `LayoutManager` for a `RecyclerView` programmatically.  
* **A view holder**.  
 The view holder extends the `ViewHolder` class. It contains the view information for displaying one item from the item's layout. View holders also add information that `RecyclerView` uses to efficiently move views around the screen.  
 * The `onBindViewHolder()` method in the adapter adapts the data to the views. You always override this method. Typically, `onBindViewHolder()` inflates the layout for an item, and puts the data in the views in the layout.  
 * Because the `RecyclerView` knows nothing about the data, the `Adapter` needs to inform the `RecyclerView` when that data changes. Use `notifyDataSetChanged()`to notify the `Adapter` that the data has changed.  
* **An adapter**.   
 The adapter connects your data to the `RecyclerView`. It adapts the data so that it can be displayed in a `ViewHolder`. A `RecyclerView` uses the adapter to figure out how to display the data on the screen.  
 The adapter requires you to implement the following methods:   
– `getItemCount()` to return the number of items.   
– `onCreateViewHolder()` to return the `ViewHolder` for an item in the list.   
– `onBindViewHolder()` to adapt the data to the views for an item in the list.

### Adding a [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView)  
  
#### Step 1: Add `RecyclerView` with `LayoutManager`  
  
1. Open the module `build.gradle` file, scroll to the end, add a new dependency.  
  
```kotlin  
implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'  
```  
  
2. Open the `fragment_sleep_tracker.xml` layout file in the **Code** tab in Android Studio and replace the entire `ScrollView`, including the enclosed `TextView`, with a `RecyclerView`.  
3. Add a layout manager to the `RecyclerView` XML. Every `RecyclerView` needs a layout manager that tells it how to position items in the list. Android provides a `LinearLayoutManager`, which by default lays out the items in a vertical list of full width rows.  
  
```xml  
 <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView  
  android:id="@+id/sleep_list"  
  android:layout_width="0dp"  
  android:layout_height="0dp"  
  app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/clear_button"  
  app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"  
  app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"  
  app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/stop_button"  
  app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager"/>  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Create the list item layout and text view holder  
  
The `RecyclerView` is only a container. In this step, you create the layout and infrastructure for the items to be displayed inside the `RecyclerView`.  
  
To get to a working `RecyclerView` as quickly as possible, at first you use a simplistic list item that only displays the sleep quality as a number. For this, you need a view holder, `TextItemViewHolder`. You also need a view, a `TextView`, for the data. (In a later step, you learn more about view holders and how to lay out all the sleep data.)  
  
1. Create a layout file called `text_item_view.xml`. It doesn't matter what you use as the root element, because you'll replace the template code.  
2. In `text_item_view.xml`, delete all the given code.  
3. Add a `TextView` with `16dp` padding at the start and end, and a text size of `24sp`. Let the width match the parent, and the height wrap the content. Because this view is displayed inside the `RecyclerView`, you don't have to place the view inside a `ViewGroup`.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<TextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"  
 android:textSize="24sp"  
 android:paddingStart="16dp"  
 android:paddingEnd="16dp"  
 android:layout_width="match_parent"    
 android:layout_height="wrap_content" />  
```  
  
4. Open `Util.kt`. Scroll to the end and add the definition that's shown below, which creates the `TextItemViewHolder` class. Put the code at the bottom of the file, after the last closing brace. The code goes in `Util.kt` because this view holder is temporary, and you replace it later.  
  
```kotlin  
class TextItemViewHolder(val textView: TextView): RecyclerView.ViewHolder(textView)  
```  
  
5. If you are prompted, import `android.widget.TextView` and `androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView`.  
  
  
#### Step 3: Create `SleepNightAdapter`  
  
The core task in implementing a `RecyclerView` is creating the [adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter). You have a simple view holder for the item view, and a layout for each item. You can now create an adapter. The adapter creates a view holder and fills it with data for the `RecyclerView` to display.  
  
1. In the `sleeptracker` package, create a new Kotlin class called `SleepNightAdapter`.  
2. Make the `SleepNightAdapter` class extend `RecyclerView.Adapter`. The class is called `SleepNightAdapter` because it adapts a `SleepNight` object into something that `RecyclerView` can use. The adapter needs to know what view holder to use, so pass in `TextItemViewHolder`. Import necessary components when prompted, and then you'll see an error, because there are mandatory methods to implement.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter: RecyclerView.Adapter<TextItemViewHolder>() {}  
```  
  
3. At the top level of `SleepNightAdapter`, create a `listOf` `SleepNight` a data source variable to hold the data.  
  
```kotlin  
var data =  listOf<SleepNight>()  
```  
  
4. In `SleepNightAdapter`, override `getItemCount()` to return the size of the list of sleep nights in `data`. The `RecyclerView` needs to know how many items the adapter has for it to display, and it does that by calling `getItemCount()`.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun getItemCount() = data.size  
```  
  
5. In `SleepNightAdapter`, override the `onBindViewHolder()` function, as shown below. The `onBindViewHolder()`function is called by `RecyclerView` to display the data for one list item at the specified position. So the `onBindViewHolder()` method takes two arguments: a view holder, and a position of the data to bind. For this app, the holder is the `TextItemViewHolder`, and the position is the position in the list.  
   
```kotlin  
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: TextItemViewHolder, position: Int) {}  
```  
  
6. Inside `onBindViewHolder()`, create a variable for one item at a given position in the data.  
  
```kotlin  
val item = data[position]  
```  
  
7. The `ViewHolder` you created has a property called `textView`. Inside `onBindViewHolder()`, set the `text` of the `textView` to the sleep-quality number. This code displays only a list of numbers, but this simple example lets you see how the adapter gets the data into the view holder and onto the screen.  
  
```kotlin  
holder.textView.text = item.sleepQuality.toString()  
```  
  
8. In `SleepNightAdapter`, override and implement `onCreateViewHolder()`, which is called when the `RecyclerView` needs a view holder to represent an item. This function takes two parameters and returns a `ViewHolder`. The `parent` parameter, which is the view group that holds the view holder, is always the `RecyclerView`. The `viewType` parameter is used when there are multiple views in the same `RecyclerView`. For example, if you put a list of text views, an image, and a video all in the same `RecyclerView`, the `onCreateViewHolder()` function would need to know what type of view to use.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): TextItemViewHolder {}  
```  
  
9. In `onCreateViewHolder()`, create an instance of `LayoutInflater`. The layout inflater knows how to create views from XML layouts. The `context` contains information on how to correctly inflate the view. In an adapter for a recycler view, you always pass in the context of the `parent` view group, which is the `RecyclerView`.  
  
```kotlin  
val layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)  
```  
  
10. In `onCreateViewHolder()`, create the `view` by asking the `layoutinflater` to inflate it. Pass in the XML layout for the view, and the `parent` view group for the view. The third, boolean, argument is `attachToRoot`. This argument needs to be `false`, because `RecyclerView` adds this item to the view hierarchy for you when it's time.  
  
```kotlin  
val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.text_item_view, parent, false) as TextView  
```  
  
11. In `onCreateViewHolder()`, return a `TextItemViewHolder` made with `view`.  
  
```kotlin  
return TextItemViewHolder(view)  
```  
  
12. The adapter needs to let the `RecyclerView` know when the `data` has changed, because the `RecyclerView` knows nothing about the data. It only knows about the view holders that the adapter gives to it. To tell the `RecyclerView` when the data that it's displaying has changed, add a custom setter to the `data` variable that's at the top of the `SleepNightAdapter` class. In the setter, give `data` a new value, then call `notifyDataSetChanged()` to trigger redrawing the list with the new data.  
  
```kotlin  
var data = listOf<SleepNight>()  
  set(value) {  
  field = value  
  notifyDataSetChanged()  
  }  
```  
  
**Note:** When `notifyDataSetChanged()` is called, the `RecyclerView` redraws the whole list, not just the changed items. This is simple, and it works for now. You improve on this code later.  
  
`SleepNightAdapter` full code should be like:  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter : RecyclerView.Adapter<TextItemViewHolder>() {  
  
 var data = listOf<SleepNight>()  
 set(value) {  
 field = value  
 notifyDataSetChanged()  
 }  
  
 override fun getItemCount() = data.size  
  
 override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: TextItemViewHolder, position: Int) {  
 val item = data[position]  
 holder.textView.text = item.sleepQuality.toString()  
 }  
  
 override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): TextItemViewHolder {  
  
 val layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)  
 val view = layoutInflater  
 .inflate(R.layout.text_item_view, parent, false) as TextView  
  
 return TextItemViewHolder(view)  
 }  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 4: Tell RecyclerView about the Adapter  
  
The `RecyclerView` needs to know about the adapter to use to get view holders.  
  
1. Open `SleepTrackerFragment.kt`. In `onCreateview()`, create an adapter. Put this code after the creation of the `ViewModel` model, and before the `return` statement.  
  
```kotlin  
val adapter = SleepNightAdapter()  
```  
  
2. Associate the `adapter` with the `RecyclerView` using binding.  
  
```kotlin  
binding.sleepList.adapter = adapter  
```  
  
3. Clean and rebuild your project to update the `binding` object. If you still see errors around `binding.sleepList` or `binding.FragmentSleepTrackerBinding`, invalidate caches and restart. (Select **File > Invalidate Caches / Restart**.)  
  
#### Step 5: Get data into the adapter  
  
So far you have an adapter, and a way to get data from the adapter into the `RecyclerView`. Now you need to get data into the adapter from the `ViewModel`.  
  
1. Open `SleepTrackerViewModel`. Find the `nights` variable, which stores all the sleep nights, which is the data to display. The `nights` variable is set by calling `getAllNights()` on the database. Remove `private` from `nights`, because you will create an observer that needs to access this variable. Your declaration should look like this:  
  
```kotlin  
val nights = database.getAllNights()  
```  
  
2. In the `database` package, open the `SleepDatabaseDao`. Find the `getAllNights()` function. Notice that this function returns a list of `SleepNight` values as `LiveData`. This means that the `nights` variable contains `LiveData` that is kept updated by `Room`, and you can observe `nights` to know when it changes.  
  
3. Open `SleepTrackerFragment`. In `onCreateView()`, below the creation of the `adapter`, create an observer on the `nights` variable. By supplying the fragment's `viewLifecycleOwner` as the lifecycle owner, you can make sure this observer is only active when the `RecyclerView` is on the screen.  
  
```kotlin  
sleepTrackerViewModel.nights.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, Observer {   })  
```  
  
4. Inside the observer, whenever you get a non-null value (for `nights`), assign the value to the adapter's `data`. This is the completed code for the observer and setting the data:  
  
  
```kotlin  
sleepTrackerViewModel.nights.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, Observer {  
 it?.let {  
 adapter.data = it  
 }  
})  
```  
  
#### Debugging tips  
  
If your app compiles but doesn't work, here are a few things to check:  
  
* Make sure you've added at least one night of sleep.  
* Do you call `notifyDataSetChanged()` in `SleepNightAdapter`?  
* Try setting a breakpoint to make sure it's getting called.  
* Did you register an observer on `sleepTrackerViewModel.nights` in `SleepTrackerFragment`?  
* Did you set the adapter in `SleepTrackerFragment` with `binding.sleepList.adapter = adapter`?  
* Does `data` in `SleepNightAdapter` hold a non-empty list?  
* Try setting a breakpoint in the setter and `getItemCount()`.

### Recycling [ViewHolders](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder)  
  
`RecyclerView` _recycles_ view holders, which means that it reuses them. As a view scrolls off the screen, `RecyclerView` reuses the view for the view that's about to scroll onto the screen.  
  
Because these view holders are recycled, make sure `onBindViewHolder()` sets or resets any customizations that previous items might have set on a view holder.  
  
For example, you could set the text color to red in view holders that hold quality ratings that are less than or equal to 1 and represent poor sleep.  
  
1. In the `SleepNightAdapter` class, add the following code to at the end of `onBindViewHolder()`.  
  
```kotlin  
if (item.sleepQuality <= 1) {  
  holder.textView.setTextColor(Color.RED) // red  
}  
```  
  
2. Run the app. Add some low sleep-quality data, and the number is red. Add high ratings for sleep quality until you see a red high number on the screen. As `RecyclerView` reuses view holders, it eventually reuses one of the red view holders for a high quality rating. The high rating is erroneously displayed in red.  
  
3. To fix this, add an `else` statement to set the color to black if the quality is not less than or equal to one. With both conditions explicit, the view holder will use the correct text color for each item.  
  
```kotlin  
if (item.sleepQuality <= 1) {  
  holder.textView.setTextColor(Color.RED) // red  
} else {  
  // reset  
  holder.textView.setTextColor(Color.BLACK) // black  
}  
```  
  
***  
  
### [ViewHolders](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html)  
  
Before we dive into making our own `ViewHolder`, let's take a look at the starter `ViewHolder` that was provided for this lesson.  
  
* If you open `Utill.kt`, you will find the definition of `TextItemViewHolder`. Taking a look at this declaration, it doesn't look like it's doing very much. It's basic directing a `TextView` in a `TextItemViewHolder` by declaring it as a wall, it's available as a property.  
  
```kotlin  
class TextItemViewHolder(val textView: TextView): RecyclerView.ViewHolder(textView)  
```  
  
* So why does `RecyclerView` not just use a `TextView` directly? This one line of code provides a lot of functionality. A `ViewHolder` describes an item view and metadata about its place within the `RecyclerView`. `RecyclerView` relies on this functionality to correctly position the view as the list scrolls, and to do interesting things like animate views when items are added or removed in the `Adapter`.  
  
**A ViewHolder** describes an item view and metadata about its place within the `RecyclerView`. In other words, a `ViewHolder` tells a `RecyclerView` where and how an item should get drawn in the list.  
  
**[itemView](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html#itemview)** is the reference that `RecyclerView` reviews when it needs to access the actual view that's being displayed.  
* `RecyclerView` will use `itemView` when binding an item to display on the screen, when drawing decorations around the view like a border, and for accessibility.  
* `RecyclerView` doesn't care what kind of view is starting `itemView`. You can put anything you want here, like a `TextView` or even a constraint layout.  
  
**[getAdapterPosition](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html#getAdapterPosition%28%29)()** can be used by the `RecyclerView` to figure out the position in the list that was bound to a particular `ViewHolder`.  
  
**[getLayoutPosition](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html#getLayoutPosition%28%29)()** can used to know in what position the `ViewHolder` was displayed.  
  
Most of these methods are final. `RecyclerView` will provide them for us and we won't ever need to coat them. However, there is one method that you might provide. Your `ViewHolder` can tell `RecyclerView` what its ID is. An ID is just a unique identifier like night ID on our sleep night. When you override [getItemId](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html#getItemId%28%29)(), `RecyclerView` can use this ID when performing animations.  
  
### Display the `SleepQuality` List  
In this step, you create the layout file for one item. The layout consists of a `ConstraintLayout` with an `ImageView` for the sleep quality, a `TextView` for the sleep length, and a `TextView` for the quality as text. Because you've done layouts before, copy and paste the provided XML code.  
  
  
#### Step 1: Create the item layout  
  
1. Create a new layout resource file and name it `list_item_sleep_night`.  
2. Replace all the code in the file with the code below. Then familiarize yourself with the layout you just created.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"  
  xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"  
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"  
  android:layout_width="match_parent"  
  android:layout_height="wrap_content">  
  
  <ImageView  
  android:id="@+id/quality_image"  
  android:layout_width="@dimen/icon_size"  
  android:layout_height="60dp"  
  android:layout_marginStart="16dp"  
  android:layout_marginTop="8dp"  
  android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"  
  app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"  
  app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"  
  app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"  
  tools:srcCompat="@drawable/ic_sleep_5" />  
  
  <TextView  
  android:id="@+id/sleep_length"  
  android:layout_width="0dp"  
  android:layout_height="20dp"  
  android:layout_marginStart="8dp"  
  android:layout_marginTop="8dp"  
  android:layout_marginEnd="16dp"  
  app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"  
  app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/quality_image"  
  app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="@+id/quality_image"  
  tools:text="Wednesday" />  
  
  <TextView  
  android:id="@+id/quality_string"  
  android:layout_width="0dp"  
  android:layout_height="20dp"  
  android:layout_marginTop="8dp"  
  app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="@+id/sleep_length"  
  app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias="0.0"  
  app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="@+id/sleep_length"  
  app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/sleep_length"  
  tools:text="Excellent!!!" />  
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Create `ViewHolder`  
  
1. Open `SleepNightAdapter.kt`. Make a class inside the `SleepNightAdapter` called `ViewHolder` and make it extend `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.  
  
```kotlin  
class ViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView){}  
```  
  
2. Inside `ViewHolder`, get references to the views. You need a reference to the views that this `ViewHolder` will update. Every time you bind this `ViewHolder`, you need to access the image and both text views. (You convert this code to use data binding later.)  
  
```kotlin  
val sleepLength: TextView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.sleep_length)  
val quality: TextView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.quality_string)  
val qualityImage: ImageView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.quality_image)  
```  
  
#### Step 3: Use the `ViewHolder` in `SleepNightAdapter`  
  
1. In the `SleepNightAdapter` definition, instead of `TextItemViewHolder`, use the `SleepNightAdapter.ViewHolder` that you just created.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter: RecyclerView.Adapter<SleepNightAdapter.ViewHolder>() {}  
```  
  
2. Update `onCreateViewHolder()`:  
 * Change the signature of `onCreateViewHolder()` to return the `ViewHolder`.  
 * Change the layout inflator to use the correct layout resource, `list_item_sleep_night`_._  
 * Remove the cast to `TextView`.  
 * Instead of returning a `TextItemViewHolder`, return a `ViewHolder`.  
 Here is the finished updated `onCreateViewHolder()` function:  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onCreateViewHolder(  
 parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {  
 val layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)  
 val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_sleep_night, parent, false)  
 return ViewHolder(view)  
}  
```  
  
3. Update `onBindViewHolder()`:  
 * Change the signature of `onBindViewHolder()` so that the `holder` parameter is a `ViewHolder` instead of a `TextItemViewHolder`.  
 * Inside `onBindViewHolder()`, delete all the code, except for the definition of `item`.  
 * Define a `val` `res` that holds a reference to the `resources` for this view.  
  
```kotlin  
val res = holder.itemView.context.resources  
```  
  
 * Set the text of the `sleepLength` text view to the duration. Copy the code below, which calls a formatting function that's provided with the starter code.  
  
```kotlin  
holder.sleepLength.text = convertDurationToFormatted(item.startTimeMilli, item.endTimeMilli, res)  
```  
  
 * This gives an error, because `convertDurationToFormatted()` needs to be defined. Open `Util.kt` and uncomment the code and associated imports for it. (Select **Code > Comment with Line comments**.)  
 * Back in `onBindViewHolder()`, use `convertNumericQualityToString()` to set the quality.  
  
```kotlin  
holder.quality.text= convertNumericQualityToString(item.sleepQuality, res)  
```  
  
 * You may need to manually import these functions.  
  
```kotlin  
import com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.convertDurationToFormatted  
import com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.convertNumericQualityToString  
```  
  
 * Set the correct icon for the quality. The new `ic_sleep_active` icon is provided for you in the starter code.  
  
```kotlin  
holder.qualityImage.setImageResource(when (item.sleepQuality) {  
  0 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_0  
  1 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_1  
  2 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_2  
  3 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_3  
  4 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_4  
  5 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_5  
  else -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_active  
})  
```  
  
Here is the finished updated `onBindViewHolder()` function, setting all the data for the `ViewHolder`:  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {  
 val item = data[position]  
 val res = holder.itemView.context.resources  
 holder.sleepLength.text = convertDurationToFormatted(item.startTimeMilli, item.endTimeMilli, res)  
 holder.quality.text = convertNumericQualityToString(item.sleepQuality, res)  
 holder.qualityImage.setImageResource(when (item.sleepQuality) {  
 0 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_0  
 1 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_1  
 2 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_2  
 3 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_3  
 4 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_4  
 5 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_5  
 else -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_active  
 })  
}  
```  
  
***  
  
### Refactor `onBindViewHolder`  
  
Your `RecyclerView` is now complete! You learned how to implement an `Adapter` and a `ViewHolder`, and you put them together to display a list with a `RecyclerView` `Adapter`.  
  
Your code so far shows the process of creating an adapter and view holder. However, you can improve this code. The code to display and the code to manage view holders is mixed up, and `onBindViewHolder()` knows details about how to update the `ViewHolder`.  
  
In a production app, you might have multiple view holders, more complex adapters, and multiple developers making changes. You should structure your code so that everything related to a view holder is only in the view holder.  
  
#### Step 1: Refactor `onBindViewHolder()`  
  
In this step, you refactor the code and move all the view holder functionality into the `ViewHolder`. The purpose of this refactoring is not to change how the app looks to the user, but make it easier and safer for developers to work on the code. Fortunately, Android Studio has tools to help.  
  
1. In `SleepNightAdapter`, in `onBindViewHolder()`, select everything except the statement to declare the variable `item`.  
2. Right-click, then select **Refactor > Extract > Function**.  
3. Name the function `bind` and accept the suggested parameters. Click **OK**. The `bind()` function is placed below `onBindViewHolder()`.  
  
```kotlin  
private fun bind(holder: ViewHolder, item: SleepNight) {  
 val res = holder.itemView.context.resources  
 holder.sleepLength.text = convertDurationToFormatted(item.startTimeMilli, item.endTimeMilli, res)  
 holder.quality.text = convertNumericQualityToString(item.sleepQuality, res)  
 holder.qualityImage.setImageResource(when (item.sleepQuality) {  
 0 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_0  
 1 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_1  
 2 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_2  
 3 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_3  
 4 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_4  
 5 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_5  
 else -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_active  
 })  
}  
```  
  
4. Put the cursor on the word `holder` of the `holder` parameter of `bind()`. Press `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on a Mac) to open the intention menu. Select **Convert parameter to receiver** to convert this to an extension function that has the following signature:  
  
```kotlin  
private fun ViewHolder.bind(item: SleepNight) {...}  
```  
  
5. Cut and paste the `bind()` function into the `ViewHolder`.  
6. Make `bind()` public.  
7. Import `bind()` into the adapter, if necessary.  
8. Because it's now in the `ViewHolder`, you can remove the `ViewHolder` part of the signature. Here is the final code for the `bind()` function in the `ViewHolder` class.  
  
```kotlin  
fun bind(item: SleepNight) {  
  val res = itemView.context.resources  
  sleepLength.text = convertDurationToFormatted(  
  item.startTimeMilli, item.endTimeMilli, res)  
  quality.text = convertNumericQualityToString(  
  item.sleepQuality, res)  
  qualityImage.setImageResource(when (item.sleepQuality) {  
  0 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_0  
  1 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_1  
  2 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_2  
  3 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_3  
  4 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_4  
  5 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_5  
  else -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_active  
  })  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Refactor `onCreateViewHolder`  
  
The `onCreateViewHolder()` method in the adapter currently inflates the view from the layout resource for the `ViewHolder`. However, inflation has nothing to do with the adapter, and everything to do with the `ViewHolder`. Inflation should happen in the `ViewHolder`.  
  
1. In `onCreateViewHolder()`, select all the code in the body of the function. Right-click, then select **Refactor > Extract > Function**. Name the function `from` and accept the suggested parameters. Click **OK**.  
2. Put the cursor on the function name `from`. Press `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on a Mac) to open the intention menu. Select **Move to companion object**. The `from()` function needs to be in a companion object so it can be called on the `ViewHolder` class, not called on a `ViewHolder` instance.  
3. Move the `companion` object into the `ViewHolder` class.  
4. Make `from()` public.  
5. In `onCreateViewHolder()`, change the `return` statement to return the result of calling `from()` in the `ViewHolder` class.   
  
Your completed `onCreateViewHolder()` and `from()` methods should look like the code below, and your code should build and run without errors.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {  
 return ViewHolder.from(parent)  
}  
```  
  
```kotlin  
companion object {  
 fun from(parent: ViewGroup): ViewHolder {  
 val layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)  
 val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_sleep_night, parent, false)  
  
 return ViewHolder(view)  
 }  
}  
```  
  
6. Change the signature of the `ViewHolder` class so that the constructor is private. Because `from()` is now a method that returns a new `ViewHolder` instance, there's no reason for anyone to call the constructor of `ViewHolder` anymore.  
  
```kotlin  
class ViewHolder private constructor(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView){}  
```  
  
### Improving Data Refresh  
  
Here is a recap of using `RecyclerView` with the adapter pattern to display sleep data to the user.  
* From user input, the app creates a list of `SleepNight` objects. Each `SleepNight` object represents a single night of sleep, its duration, and quality.  
* The `SleepNightAdapter` adapts the list of `SleepNight` objects into something `RecyclerView` can use and display.  
* The `SleepNightAdapter` adapter produces `ViewHolders` that contain the views, data, and meta information for the recycler view to display the data.  
* `RecyclerView` uses the `SleepNightAdapter` to determine how many items there are to display (`getItemCount()`). `RecyclerView` uses `onCreateViewHolder()` and `onBindViewHolder()` to get view holders bound to data for displaying.  
  
#### The [notifyDataSetChanged()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html#notifyDataSetChanged()) method is inefficient  
  
* To tell `RecyclerView` that an item in the list has changed and needs to be updated, the current code calls [`notifyDataSetChanged()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter) in the `SleepNightAdapter`, as shown below.  
  
```kotlin  
var data = listOf<SleepNight>()  
  set(value) {  
  field = value  
  notifyDataSetChanged()  
  }  
```  
  
* However, `notifyDataSetChanged()` tells `RecyclerView` that the entire list is potentially invalid. As a result, `RecyclerView` rebinds and redraws every item in the list, including items that are not visible on screen. This is a lot of unnecessary work. For large or complex lists, this process could take long enough that the display flickers or stutters as the user scrolls through the list.  
  
* To fix this problem, you can tell `RecyclerView` exactly what has changed. `RecyclerView` can then update only the views that changed on screen.  
  
* `RecyclerView` has a rich API for updating a single element. You could use [`notifyItemChanged()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyitemchanged) to tell `RecyclerView` that an item has changed, and you could use similar functions for items that are added, removed, or moved. You could do it all manually, but that task would be non-trivial and might involve quite a bit of code. Fortunately, there's a better way.  
  
#### [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/util/DiffUtil): an efficient way that does the hard work for you  
  
`RecyclerView` has a class called `DiffUtil` which is for calculating the differences between two lists. `DiffUtil` takes an old list and a new list and figures out what's different. It finds items that were added, removed, or changed. Then it uses an algorithm called a [Eugene W. Myers's difference algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) to figure out the minimum number of changes to make from the old list to produce the new list.  
  
Once `DiffUtil` figures out what has changed, `RecyclerView` can use that information to update only the items that were changed, added, removed, or moved, which is much more efficient than redoing the entire list.  
  
***  
  
### Refresh Data with [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/util/DiffUtil)  
#### Step 1: Implement `SleepNightDiffCallback`  
  
In order to use the functionality of the `DiffUtil` class, extend `DiffUtil.ItemCallback`.  
  
1. Open `SleepNightAdapter.kt`.  
2. Below the full class definition for `SleepNightAdapter`, make a new top-level class called `SleepNightDiffCallback` that extends `DiffUtil.ItemCallback`. Pass `SleepNight` as a generic parameter.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightDiffCallback : DiffUtil.ItemCallback<SleepNight>() {}  
```  
  
3. Put the cursor in the `SleepNightDiffCallback` class name. Press `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on Mac) and select **Implement Members**. In the dialog that opens, shift-left-click to select the `areItemsTheSame()` and `areContentsTheSame()` methods, then click **OK**.   
 This generates stubs inside `SleepNightDiffCallback` for the two methods, as shown below. `DiffUtil` uses these two methods to figure out how the list and items have changed.  
   
```kotlin  
override fun areItemsTheSame(oldItem: SleepNight, newItem: SleepNight): Boolean {  
 TODO("not implemented") //To change body of created functions use File | Settings | File Templates.  
}  
  
override fun areContentsTheSame(oldItem: SleepNight, newItem: SleepNight): Boolean {  
 TODO("not implemented") //To change body of created functions use File | Settings | File Templates.  
}  
```  
  
4. Inside `areItemsTheSame()`, replace the `TODO` with code that tests whether the two passed-in `SleepNight` items, `oldItem` and `newItem`, are the same. If the items have the same `nightId`, they are the same item, so return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`. `DiffUtil` uses this test to help discover if an item was added, removed, or moved.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun areItemsTheSame(oldItem: SleepNight, newItem: SleepNight): Boolean {  
  return oldItem.nightId == newItem.nightId  
}  
```  
  
5. Inside `areContentsTheSame()`, check whether `oldItem` and `newItem` contain the same data; that is, whether they are equal. This equality check will check all the fields, because `SleepNight` is a data class. `Data` classes automatically define `equals` and a few other methods for you. If there are differences between `oldItem` and `newItem`, this code tells `DiffUtil` that the item has been updated.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun areContentsTheSame(oldItem: SleepNight, newItem: SleepNight): Boolean {  
  return oldItem == newItem  
}  
```  
  
The full code of `SleepNightDiffCallback` should be like:  
  
```kotlin  
/**  
 * Callback for calculating the diff between two non-null items in a list.  
 *  
 * Used by ListAdapter to calculate the minumum number of changes between and old list and a new  
 * list that's been passed to `submitList`.  
 */  
class SleepNightDiffCallback : DiffUtil.ItemCallback<SleepNight>() {  
 override fun areItemsTheSame(oldItem: SleepNight, newItem: SleepNight): Boolean {  
 return oldItem.nightId == newItem.nightId  
 }  
  
 override fun areContentsTheSame(oldItem: SleepNight, newItem: SleepNight): Boolean {  
 return oldItem == newItem  
 }  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Change your adapter to extend `ListAdapter`  
  
It's a common pattern to use a `RecyclerView` to display a list that changes. `RecyclerView` provides an adapter class, `ListAdapter`, that helps you build a `RecyclerView` adapter that's backed by a list.  
  
`ListAdapter` keeps track of the list for you and notifies the adapter when the list is updated.  
  
1. In the `SleepNightAdapter.kt` file, change the class signature of `SleepNightAdapter` to extend `ListAdapter`. If prompted, import `androidx.recyclerview.widget.ListAdapter`.  
2. Add `SleepNight` as the first argument to the `ListAdapter`, before `SleepNightAdapter.ViewHolder`.  
3. Add `SleepNightDiffCallback()` as a parameter to the constructor. The `ListAdapter` will use this to figure out what changed in the list. Your finished `SleepNightAdapter` class signature should look as shown below.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter : ListAdapter<SleepNight, SleepNightAdapter.ViewHolder>(SleepNightDiffCallback()) {}  
```  
  
4. Inside the `SleepNightAdapter` class, delete the `data` field, including the setter. You don't need it anymore, because `ListAdapter` keeps track of the list for you.  
5. Delete the override of `getItemCount()`, because the `ListAdapter` implements this method for you.  
6. To get rid of the error in `onBindViewHolder()`, change the `item` variable. Instead of using `data` to get an `item`, call the `getItem(position)` method that the `ListAdapter` provides.  
  
```kotlin  
val item = getItem(position)  
```  
  
Your code needs to tell the `ListAdapter` when a changed list is available. `ListAdapter` provides a method called `submitList()` to tell `ListAdapter` that a new version of the list is available. When this method is called, the `ListAdapter` diffs the new list against the old one and detects items that were added, removed, moved, or changed. Then the `ListAdapter` updates the items shown by `RecyclerView`.  
  
1. Open `SleepTrackerFragment.kt`.  
2. In `onCreateView()`, in the observer on `sleepTrackerViewModel`, find the error where the `data` variable that you've deleted is referenced.  
3. Replace `adapter.data = it` with a call to `adapter.submitList(it)`. The updated code is shown below.  
  
```kotlin  
sleepTrackerViewModel.nights.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, Observer {  
  it?.let {  
  adapter.submitList(it)  
  }  
})  
```  
  
***  
  
### Using `DataBinding` with `RecyclerView`  
  
With data binding, we can easily observe and show the data to the UI from a data source.  
  
  
#### Step 1: Add data binding to the layout file  
  
1. Open the `list_item_sleep_night.xml` layout file in the **Text** tab.  
2. Put the cursor on the `ConstraintLayout` tag and press `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on a Mac). The intention menu (the "quick fix" menu) opens.  
3. Select **Convert to data binding layout**. This wraps the layout into `<layout>` and adds a `<data>` tag inside.  
4. Scroll back to the top, if necessary, and inside the `<data>` tag, declare a variable named `sleep`.  
5. Make its `type` the fully qualified name of `SleepNight`, `com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.database.SleepNight`. Your finished `<data>` tag should look as shown below.  
  
```xml  
<data>  
 <variable  
 name="sleep"  
 type="com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.database.SleepNight"/>  
</data>  
```  
  
6. To force the creation of the `Binding` object, select **Build > Clean Project**, then select **Build > Rebuild Project**. (If you still have problems, select **File > Invalidate Caches / Restart**.) The `ListItemSleepNightBinding` binding object, along with related code, is added to the project's generated files.  
  
#### Step 2: Inflate the item layout using data binding  
  
1. Open `SleepNightAdapter.kt`. In the `ViewHolder` class, find the `onCreateViewHolder()` method. Delete the declaration of the `view` variable.  
  
```kotlin  
val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_sleep_night, parent, false)  
```  
2. Where the `view` variable was, define a new variable called `binding` that inflates the `ListItemSleepNightBinding` binding object, as shown below. Make the necessary import of the binding object.  
  
```kotlin  
val binding =  
ListItemSleepNightBinding.inflate(layoutInflater, parent, false)  
```  
  
3. At the end of the function, instead of returning the `view`, return `binding`.  
  
```kotlin  
return ViewHolder(binding)  
```  
  
4. To get rid of the error, place your cursor on the word `binding`. Press `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on a Mac) to open the intention menu. Select **Change parameter 'itemView' type of primary constructor of class 'ViewHolder' to 'ListItemSleepNightBinding'**. This updates the parameter type of the `ViewHolder` class.  
5. Scroll up to the class definition of the `ViewHolder` to see the change in the signature. You see an error for `itemView`, because you changed `itemView` to `binding` in the `from()` method. In the `ViewHolder` class definition, right-click on one of the occurrences of `itemView` and select **Refactor** \> **Rename**. Change the name to `binding`. Prefix the constructor parameter `binding` with `val` to make it a property.  
6. In the call to the parent class, `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`, change the parameter from `binding` to `binding.root`. You need to pass a `View`, and `binding.root` is the root `ConstraintLayout` in your item layout.  
  
Your finished class declaration should look like the code below.  
  
```kotlin  
class ViewHolder private constructor(val binding: ListItemSleepNightBinding) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root){}  
```  
  
#### Step 3: Replace `findViewById()`  
  
You can now update the `sleepLength`, `quality`, and `qualityImage` properties to use the `binding` object instead of `findViewById()`.  
  
1. Change the initializations of `sleepLength`, `qualityString`, and `qualityImage` to use the views of the `binding` object, as shown below. After this, your code should not show any more errors.  
  
```kotlin  
val sleepLength: TextView = binding.sleepLength  
val quality: TextView = binding.qualityString  
val qualityImage: ImageView = binding.qualityImage  
```  
  
Once your code is compiling you can inline the new definitions. Do this by right clicking on each field, then selecting _Refactor > Inline_. Select _Inline all references and remove the property_ to tell Android studio to remove the property.  
  
Inline is a very common refactor. It's worth taking a moment to learn the keyboard shortcut. You can find the keyboard shortcut in the context menu next to _Inline_.  
  
2. Right-click on the `sleepLength`, `quality`, and `qualityImage` property names. Select **Refactor > Inline**, or press `Control+Command+N` (`Option+Command+N` on a Mac).  
  
Your refactored `ViewHolder` should now look like this:  
  
```kotlin  
class ViewHolder private constructor(val binding: ListItemSleepNightBinding): RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root) {  
  
fun bind(item: SleepNight) {  
 val res = itemView.context.resources  
 binding.sleepLength.text = convertDurationToFormatted(item.startTimeMilli, item.endTimeMilli, res)  
 binding.qualityString.text = convertNumericQualityToString(item.sleepQuality, res)  
 binding.qualityImage.setImageResource(when (item.sleepQuality) {  
 0 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_0  
 1 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_1  
 2 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_2  
 3 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_3  
 4 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_4  
 5 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_5  
 else -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_active  
 })  
}  
  
companion object {  
 fun from(parent: ViewGroup): ViewHolder {  
 val layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)  
 val binding = ListItemSleepNightBinding.inflate(layoutInflater, parent, false)  
 return ViewHolder(binding)  
 }  
}  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 4: Create [binding adapters](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)  
In a previous lesson, you used the [`Transformations`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/Transformations) class to take `LiveData` and generate formatted strings to display in text views. However, if you need to bind different types, or complex types, you can provide binding adapters to help data binding use those types. Binding adapters are adapters that take your data and adapt it into something that data binding can use to bind a view, like text or an image.  
  
You are going to implement three binding adapters, one for the quality image, and one for each text field. In summary, to declare a binding adapter, you define a method that takes an item and a view, and annotate it with `@BindingAdapter`. In the body of the method, you implement the transformation. In Kotlin, you can write a binding adapter as an extension function on the view class that receives the data.  
  
Note that you will have to import a number of classes in the step, and it will not be called out individually.  
  
1. Open `SleepNightAdapater.kt`. Inside the `ViewHolder` class, find the `bind()` method and remind yourself what this method does. You will take the code that calculates the values for `binding.sleepLength`, `binding.quality`, and `binding.qualityImage`, and use it inside the adapter instead. (For now, leave the code as it is; you move it in a later step.)  
2. In the `sleeptracker` package, create and open a file called `BindingUtils.kt`. Declare an extension function on `TextView`, called `setSleepDurationFormatted`, and pass in a `SleepNight`. This function will be your adapter for calculating and formatting the sleep duration.  
  
```kotlin  
fun TextView.setSleepDurationFormatted(item: SleepNight) {}  
```  
  
3. In the body of `setSleepDurationFormatted`, bind the data to the view as you did in `ViewHolder.bind()`. Call `convertDurationToFormatted()`and then set the `text` of the `TextView` to the formatted text. (Because this is an extension function on `TextView`, you can directly access the `text` property.)  
  
```kotlin  
text = convertDurationToFormatted(item.startTimeMilli, item.endTimeMilli, context.resources)  
```  
  
4. To tell data binding about this binding adapter, annotate the function with `@BindingAdapter`. This function is the adapter for the `sleepDurationFormatted` attribute, so pass `sleepDurationFormatted` as an argument to `@BindingAdapter`.  
  
```kotlin  
@BindingAdapter("sleepDurationFormatted")  
```  
  
5. The second adapter sets the sleep quality based on the value in a `SleepNight` object. Create an extension function called `setSleepQualityString()` on `TextView`, and pass in a `SleepNight`. In the body, bind the data to the view as you did in `ViewHolder.bind()`. Call `convertNumericQualityToString` and set the `text`. Annotate the function with `@BindingAdapter("sleepQualityString")`.  
  
```kotlin  
@BindingAdapter("sleepQualityString")  
fun TextView.setSleepQualityString(item: SleepNight) {  
  text = convertNumericQualityToString(item.sleepQuality, context.resources)  
}  
```  
  
6. The third binding adapter sets the image on an image view. Create the extension function on `ImageView`, call `setSleepImage`, and use the code from `ViewHolder.bind()`, as shown below.  
  
```kotlin  
@BindingAdapter("sleepImage")  
fun ImageView.setSleepImage(item: SleepNight) {  
  setImageResource(when (item.sleepQuality) {  
  0 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_0  
  1 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_1  
  2 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_2  
  3 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_3  
  4 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_4  
  5 -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_5  
  else -> R.drawable.ic_sleep_active  
  })  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 5: Update `SleepNightAdapter`  
  
1. Open `SleepNightAdapter.kt`. Delete everything in the `bind()` method, because you can now use data binding and your new adapters to do this work for you.  
2. Inside `bind()`, assign sleep to `item`, because you need tell the binding object about your new `SleepNight`.  
3. Below that line, add `binding.executePendingBindings()`. This call is an optimization that asks data binding to execute any pending bindings right away. It's always a good idea to call `executePendingBindings()` when you use binding adapters in a `RecyclerView`, because it can slightly speed up sizing the views.  
  
```kotlin  
fun bind(item: SleepNight) {  
 binding.sleep = item  
 binding.executePendingBindings()  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 6: Add bindings to XML layout  
1. Open `list_item_sleep_night.xml`. In the `ImageView`, add an `app` property with the same name as the binding adapter that sets the image. Pass in the `sleep` variable, as shown below. This property creates the connection between the view and the binding object, via the adapter. Whenever `sleepImage` is referenced, the adapter will adapt the data from the `SleepNight`.  
  
```xml  
app:sleepImage="@{sleep}"  
```  
  
2. Do the same for the `sleep_length` and the `quality_string` text views. Whenever `sleepDurationFormatted` or `sleepQualityString` are referenced, the adapters will adapt the data from the `SleepNight`.  
  
```xml  
app:sleepDurationFormatted="@{sleep}"  
```  
  
```xml  
app:sleepQualityString="@{sleep}"  
```  
  
3. Run your app. It works exactly the same as it did before. The binding adapters take care of all the work of formatting and updating the views as the data changes, simplifying the `ViewHolder` and giving the code much better structure than it had before.  
  
You've displayed the same list for the last few exercises. That's by design, to show you that the `Adapter` interface allows you to architect your code in many different ways. The more complex your code, the more important it becomes to architect it well. In production apps, these patterns and others are used with `RecyclerView`. The patterns all work, and each has its benefits. Which one you choose depends on what you are building.  
  
***  
  
### Using `GridLayout`  
  
#### Layouts and LayoutManagers  
  
In a previous task, when you added the `RecyclerView` to `fragment_sleep_tracker.xml`, you added a `LinearLayoutManager` without any customizations. This code displays the data as a vertical list.  
  
```xml  
app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager"  
```  
  
`LinearLayoutManager` is the most common and straightforward layout manager for `RecyclerView`, and it supports both horizontal and vertical placement of child views. For example, you could use `LinearLayoutManager` to create a carousel of images that the user scrolls horizontally.  
  
#### [GridLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayout)  
  
Another common use case is needing to show a lot of data to the user, which you can do using `GridLayout`. The `GridLayoutManager` for `RecyclerView` lays out the data as a scrollable grid, as shown below.  
  
![GridLayout.png](../../../GridLayout.png)  
  
From a design perspective, `GridLayout` is best for lists that can be represented as icons or images, such as lists within a photo browsing app. In the sleep-tracker app, you could show each night of sleep as a grid of large icons. This design would give the user an overview of their sleep quality at a glance.  
  
#### How GridLayout lays out items  
  
`GridLayout` arranges items in a grid of rows and columns. Assuming vertical scrolling, by default, each item in a row takes up one "span." (In this case, one span is equivalent to the width of one column.)  
  
In the first two examples shown below, each row is made up of three spans. By default, the `GridLayoutManager` lays out each item in one span until the span count, which you specify. When it reaches the span count, it wraps to the next line.  
  
By default, each item takes up one span, but you can make an item wider by specifying how many spans it is to occupy. For example, the top item in the rightmost screen (shown below) takes up three spans.  
  
**Tip:**   
>_Span_ can mean either "row" or "column." With [`GridLayoutManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayoutManager), you use `spanCount` to indicate how many columns or rows a grid has, and also how much grid space an item takes up horizontally or vertically.  
> When you create a `GridLayoutManager`, you specify the orientation separately from the number of spans, and "span" is "direction-agnostic." In a (default) vertical configuration, "span" and "column" are equivalent.  
  
***  
  
### Change LinearLayout to [GridLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayout)  
  
#### Step 1: Change the LayoutManager  
  
1. Open the `fragment_sleep_tracker.xml` layout file. Remove the layout manager from the `sleep_list` `RecyclerView` definition.  
  
```xml  
app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager  
```  
  
2. Open `SleepTrackerFragment.kt`. In `OnCreateView()`, just before the `return` statement, create a new vertical, top-to-bottom `GridLayoutManager` with 3 spans.  
  
The [`GridLayoutManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayoutManager) constructor takes up to four arguments: a context, which is the `activity`, the number spans (columns, in the default vertical layout), an orientation (default is vertical), and whether it's a reverse layout (default is `false`).  
  
```kotlin  
val manager = GridLayoutManager(activity, 3)  
```  
  
3. Below that line, tell the `RecyclerView` to use this `GridLayoutManager`. The `RecyclerView` is in the binding object and is called `sleepList`. (See `fragment_sleep_tracker.xml`.)  
  
```kotlin  
binding.sleepList.layoutManager = manager  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Change the layout  
  
The current layout in `list_item_sleep_night.xml` displays the data by using a whole row per night. In this step, you define a more compact square item layout for the grid.  
  
**Tip:** If you don't want to lose your current layout, make a copy of the file first and name it `list_item_sleep_night_linear.xml`, or comment out the code instead of removing it.  
  
1. Open `list_item_sleep_night.xml`. Delete the `sleep_length` `TextView`, because the new design doesn't need it.  
2. Move the `quality_string` `TextView` so that it displays beneath the `ImageView`. To do that, you have to update quite a few things. Here is the final layout for the `quality_string` `TextView` and `quality_image` `ImageView`:  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
  
<layout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"  
 xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"  
 xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">  
  
 <data>  
  
 <variable  
 name="sleep"  
 type="com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.database.SleepNight" />  
  
 </data>  
  
 <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout  
 android:layout_width="match_parent"  
 android:layout_height="wrap_content"  
 android:orientation="vertical">  
  
 <ImageView  
 android:id="@+id/quality_image"  
 android:layout_width="@dimen/icon_size"  
 android:layout_height="60dp"  
 android:layout_marginStart="16dp"  
 android:layout_marginTop="8dp"  
 android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"  
 app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"  
 app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"  
 app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"  
 tools:srcCompat="@drawable/ic_sleep_5"  
 app:sleepImage="@{sleep}"/>  
  
 <TextView  
 android:id="@+id/quality_string"  
 android:layout_width="0dp"  
 android:layout_height="wrap_content"  
 android:layout_marginTop="8dp"  
 app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="@+id/quality_image"  
 app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="@+id/quality_image"  
 app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/quality_image"  
 app:sleepQualityString="@{sleep}"/>  
  
 </androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>  
</layout>  
```  
  
3. Verify in the **Design** view that the `quality_string` `TextView` is positioned below the `ImageView`.  
  
Because you used data binding, you don't need to change _anything_ in the `Adapter`. The code should just work, and your list should display as a grid.  
  
4. Run the app and observe how the sleep data is displayed in a grid.  
  
Note that the `ConstraintLayout` still takes the entire width. The `GridLayoutManager` gives your view a fixed width, based on its span. `GridLayoutManager` does its best to meet all constraints when laying out the grid, adding whitespace or clipping items.  
  
5. In `SleepTrackerFragment`, in the code that creates the `GridLayoutManager`, change the number of spans for `GridLayoutManger` to 1. Run the app, and you get a list.  
  
```kotlin  
val manager = GridLayoutManager(activity, 1)  
```  
  
6. Change the number of spans for `GridLayoutManager` to 10 and run the app. Notice that the `GridLayoutManager` will fit 10 items in a row, but the items are now clipped.  
7. Change the span count to 5 and the direction to `GridLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL`. Run the app and notice how you can scroll horizontally. You would need a different layout to make this look good.  
  
```kotlin  
val manager = GridLayoutManager(activity, 5, GridLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, false)  
```  
  
8. Don't forget to set the span count back to 3 and the orientation to vertical!

### Interacting with List Items  
  
Receiving clicks and handling them is a two-part task: First, you need to listen to and receive the click and determine which item has been clicked. Then, you need to respond to the click with an action.  
  
So, what is the best place for adding a click listener for this app?  
  
* The `SleepTrackerFragment` hosts many views, and so listening to click events at the fragment level won't tell you which item was clicked. It won't even tell you whether it was an item that was clicked or one of the other UI elements.  
* Listening at the `RecyclerView` level, it's hard to figure out exactly what item in the list the user clicked on.  
* The best pace to get information about one clicked item is in the `ViewHolder` object, since it represents one list item.  
  
While the `ViewHolder` is a great place to listen for clicks, it's not usually the right place to handle them. So, what is the best place for handling the clicks?  
  
* The `Adapter` displays data items in views, so you could handle clicks in the adapter. However, the adapter's job is to adapt data for display, not deal with app logic.  
* You should usually handle clicks in the `ViewModel`, because the `ViewModel` has access to the data and logic for determining what needs to happen in response to the click.  
  
**Tip:** There are other patterns for implementing click listeners in `RecyclerViews`, but the one you work with in this lesson is easier to explain and more straightforward to implement. As you work on Android apps, you'll encounter different patterns for using click listeners in `RecyclerViews`. All the patterns have their advantages.  
  
#### Step 1: Create a click listener and trigger it from the item layout  
  
1. In the `sleeptracker` folder, open **SleepNightAdapter.kt**. At the end of the file, at the top level, create a new listener class, `SleepNightListener`.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightListener() {    }  
```  
  
2. Inside the `SleepNightListener` class, add an `onClick()` function. When the view that displays a list item is clicked, the view calls this `onClick()` function. (You will set the `android:onClick` property of the view later to this function.)  
3. Add a function argument `night` of type `SleepNight` to `onClick()`. The view knows what item it is displaying, and that information needs to be passed on for handling the click.  
4. To define what `onClick()` does, provide a `clickListener` callback in the constructor of `SleepNightListener` and assign it to `onClick()`. Giving the lambda that handles the click a name, `clickListener` , helps keep track of it as it is passed between classes. The `clickListener` callback only needs the `night.nightId` to access data from the database. Your finished `SleepNightListener` class should look like the code below.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightListener(val clickListener: (sleepId: Long) -> Unit) {  
  fun onClick(night: SleepNight) = clickListener(night.nightId)  
}  
```  
  
5. Open **list_item_sleep_night.xml.**. Inside the `data` block, add a new variable to make the `SleepNightListener` class available through data binding. Give the new `<variable>` a `name` of `clickListener.` Set the `type` to the fully qualified name of the class `com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.sleeptracker.SleepNightListener`, as shown below. You can now access the `onClick()` function in `SleepNightListener` from this layout.  
  
```kotlin  
<variable  
 name="clickListener"  
 type="com.example.android.trackmysleepquality.sleeptracker.SleepNightListener" />  
```  
  
6. To listen for clicks on any part of this list item, add the `android:onClick` attribute to the `ConstraintLayout`. Set the attribute to `clickListener.onClick(sleep)` using a data binding lambda, as shown below:  
  
```xml  
android:onClick="@{() -> clickListener.onClick(sleep)}"  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Pass the click listener to the view holder and the binding object  
  
1. Open **SleepNightAdapter.kt.** Modify the constructor of the `SleepNightAdapter` class to receive a `val clickListener: SleepNightListener`. When the adapter binds the `ViewHolder`, it will need to provide it with this click listener.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter(val clickListener: SleepNightListener):       ListAdapter<SleepNight, SleepNightAdapter.ViewHolder>(SleepNightDiffCallback()) {{}}  
```  
  
2. In `onBindViewHolder()`, update the call to `holder.bind()` to also pass the click listener to the `ViewHolder`. You will get a compiler error because you added a parameter to the function call.  
  
```kotlin  
holder.bind(clickListener,getItem(position)!!)  
```  
  
3. Add the `clickListener` parameter to `bind()`. To do this, put the cursor on the error, and press `Alt+Enter` (Windows) or `Option+Enter` (Mac) on the error.  
4. Inside the `ViewHolder` class, inside the `bind()` function, assign the click listener to the `binding` object. You see an error because you need to update the binding object.  
  
```kotlin  
fun bind(clickListener: SleepNightListener, item: SleepNight) {  
 binding.sleep = item  
 binding.clickListener = clickListener  
 binding.executePendingBindings()  
}  
```  
  
6. To update data binding, **Clean** and **Rebuild** your project. (You may need to invalidate caches as well.) So, you have taken a click listener from the adapter constructor, and passed it all the way to the view holder and into the binding object.  
  
#### Step 3: Display a toast when an item is tapped  
  
You now have the code in place to capture a click, but you haven't implemented what happens when a list item is tapped. The simplest response is to display a toast showing the `nightId` when an item is clicked. This verifies that when a list item is clicked, the correct `nightId` is captured and passed on.  
  
1. Open **SleepTrackerFragment.kt.** In `onCreateView()`, find the `adapter` variable. Notice that it shows an error, because it now expects a click listener parameter.  
2. Define a click listener by passing in a lambda to the `SleepNightAdapter`. This simple lambda just displays a toast showing the `nightId`, as shown below. You'll have to import `Toast`. Below is the complete updated definition.  
  
```kotlin  
val adapter = SleepNightAdapter(SleepNightListener { nightId ->   Toast.makeText(context, "${nightId}", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()})  
```  
  
3. Run the app, tap items, and verify that they display a toast with the correct `nightId`. Because items have increasing `nightId` values, and the app displays the most recent night first, the item with the lowest `nightId` is at the bottom of the list.  
  
***  
  
### Navigate on Click  
  
In this task, you change the behavior when an item in the `RecyclerView` is clicked, so that instead of showing a toast, the app will navigate to a detail fragment that shows more information about the clicked night.  
  
Before starting, open `fragment_sleep_detail.xml` and uncomment the code inside the `ConstraintLayout`.  
  
#### Step 1: Navigate on click  
  
In this step, instead of just displaying a toast, you change the click listener lambda in `onCreateView()` of the `SleepTrackerFragment` to pass the `nightId` to the `SleepTrackerViewModel` and trigger navigation to the `SleepDetailFragment`.  
  
##### Define the click handler function:  
  
1. Open **SleepTrackerViewModel.kt**. Inside `SleepTrackerViewModel`, towards the end, define the `onSleepNightClicked()`click handler function.  
2. Inside the `onSleepNightClicked()`, trigger navigation by setting `_navigateToSleepDetail` to the passed in `id` of the clicked sleep night.  
  
```kotlin  
fun onSleepNightClicked(id: Long) {  
  _navigateToSleepDetail.value = id  
}  
```  
  
3. Implement `_navigateToSleepDetail`. As you've done before, define a `private MutableLiveData` for the navigation state. And a public gettable `val` to go with it.  
  
```kotlin  
private val _navigateToSleepDetail = MutableLiveData<Long>()  
val navigateToSleepDetail  
  get() = _navigateToSleepDetail  
```  
  
4. Define the method to call after the app has finished navigating. Call it `onSleepDetailNavigated()` and set its value to `null`.  
  
```kotlin  
fun onSleepDetailNavigated() {  
 _navigateToSleepDetail.value = null  
}  
```  
  
##### Add the code to call the click handler:  
  
1. Open **SleepTrackerFragment.kt** and scroll down to the code that creates the adapter and defines `SleepNightListener` to show a toast.  
  
```kotlin  
val adapter = SleepNightAdapter(SleepNightListener { nightId ->  
  Toast.makeText(context, "${nightId}", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()  
})  
```  
  
2. Add the following code below the toast to call a click handler, `onSleepNightClicked()`, in the `sleepTrackerViewModel` when an item is tapped. Pass in the `nightId`, so the view model knows which sleep night to get. This leaves you with an error, because you haven't defined `onSleepNightClicked()` yet. You can keep, comment out, or delete the toast, as you wish.  
  
```kotlin  
sleepTrackerViewModel.onSleepNightClicked(nightId)  
```  
  
##### Add the code to observe clicks:  
  
Open **SleepTrackerFragment.kt**. In `onCreateView()`, right above the declaration of `manager`, add code to observe the new `navigateToSleepDetail` `LiveData`. When `navigateToSleepDetail` changes, navigate to the `SleepDetailFragment`, passing in the `night`, then call `onSleepDetailNavigated()` afterwards. Since you ‘ve done this before in a previous lesson, here is the code:  
  
```kotlin  
sleepTrackerViewModel.navigateToSleepDetail.observe(this, Observer { night ->  
 night?.let {  
 this.findNavController().navigate(  
 SleepTrackerFragmentDirections  
 .actionSleepTrackerFragmentToSleepDetailFragment(night))  
  sleepTrackerViewModel.onSleepDetailNavigated()  
 }  
 })  
  
```  
  
##### Handle null values in the binding adapters:  
  
1. Run the app again, in debug mode. Tap an item, and filter the logs to show Errors. It will show a stack trace including something like what's below.  
  
```  
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Parameter specified as non-null is null: method kotlin.jvm.internal.Intrinsics.checkParameterIsNotNull, parameter item  
```  
  
* Unfortunately, the stack trace does not make it obvious where this error is triggered. One disadvantage of data binding is that it can make it harder to debug your code. The app crashes when you click an item, and the only new code is for handling the click.  
  
* However, it turns out that with this new click-handling mechanism, it is now possible for the binding adapters to get called with a `null` value for `item`. In particular, when the app starts, the `LiveData` starts as `null`, so you need to add null checks to each of the adapters.  
  
2. In `BindingUtils.kt`, for each of the binding adapters, change the type of the `item` argument to nullable, and wrap the body with `item?.let{...}`. For example, your adapter for `sleepQualityString` will look like this. Change the other adapters likewise.  
  
```kotlin  
@BindingAdapter("sleepQualityString")  
fun TextView.setSleepQualityString(item: SleepNight?) {  
  item?.let {  
  text = convertNumericQualityToString(item.sleepQuality, context.resources)  
  }  
}  
```  
  
***  
  
### Adding Headers to the `RecyclerView`  
  
One common example is having headers in your list or grid. A list can have a single header to describe the item content. A list can also have multiple headers to group and separate items in a single list.  
  
`RecyclerView` doesn't know anything about your data or what type of layout each item has. The `LayoutManager` arranges the items on the screen, but the adapter adapts the data to be displayed and passes view holders to the `RecyclerView`. So you will add the code to create headers in the adapter.  
  
#### Two ways of adding headers  
  
In `RecyclerView`, every item in the list corresponds to an index number starting from 0. For example:  
  
**\[Actual Data\] -> \[Adapter Views\]**  
\[0: SleepNight\] -> \[0: SleepNight\]  
\[1: SleepNight\] -> \[1: SleepNight\]  
\[2: SleepNight\] -> \[2: SleepNight\]  
  
One way to add headers to a list is to modify your adapter to use a different `ViewHolder` by checking indexes where your header needs to be shown. The `Adapter` will be responsible for keeping track of the header. For example, to show a header at the top of the table, you need to return a different `ViewHolder` for the header while laying out the zero-indexed item. Then all the other items would be mapped with the header offset, as shown below.  
  
**\[Actual Data\] -> \[Adapter Views\]**  
**\[0: Header\]**  
\[0: SleepNight\] -> \[1: SleepNight\]  
\[1: SleepNight\] -> \[2: SleepNight\]  
\[2: SleepNight\] -> \[3: SleepNight.  
  
Another way to add headers is to modify the backing dataset for your data grid. Since all the data that needs to be displayed is stored in a list, you can modify the list to include items to represent a header. This is a bit simpler to understand, but it requires you to think about how you design your objects, so you can combine the different item types into a single list. Implemented this way, the adapter will display the items passed to it. So the item at position 0 is a header, and the item at position 1 is a `SleepNight`, which maps directly to what's on the screen.  
  
**\[Actual Data\] -> \[Adapter Views\]**  
**\[0: Header\] -> \[0: Header\]**  
\[1: SleepNight\] -> \[1: SleepNight\]  
\[2: SleepNight\] -> \[2: SleepNight\]  
\[3: SleepNight\] -> \[3: SleepNight\]  
  
Each methodology has benefits and drawbacks. Changing the dataset doesn't introduce much change to the rest of the adapter code, and you can add header logic by manipulating the list of data. On the other hand, using a different `ViewHolder` by checking indexes for headers gives more freedom on the layout of the header. It also lets the adapter handle how data is adapted to the view without modifying the backing data.  
  
In this lesson, you update your `RecyclerView` to display a header at the start of the list. In this case, your app will use a different `ViewHolder` for the header than for data items. The app will check the index of the list to determine which `ViewHolder` to use.  
  
***  
  
### Add a List Header  
  
#### Step 1: Create a `DataItem` class  
  
To abstract the type of item and let the adapter just deal with "items", you can create a data holder class that represents either a `SleepNight` or a `Header`. Your dataset will then be a list of data holder items.  
  
1. Open **SleepNightAdapter.kt**. Below the `SleepNightListener` class, at the top level, define a `sealed` class called `DataItem` that represents an item of data.   
   
**Note:**  
A `sealed` class defines a closed type, which means that all subclasses of `DataItem` must be defined in this file. As a result, the number of subclasses is known to the compiler. It's not possible for another part of your code to define a new type of `DataItem` that could break your adapter.  
  
```kotlin  
sealed class DataItem { }  
```  
  
2. Inside the body of the `DataItem` class, define two classes that represent the different types of data items. The first is a `SleepNightItem`, which is a wrapper around a `SleepNight`, so it takes a single value called `sleepNight`. To make it part of the sealed class, have it extend `DataItem`.  
  
```kotlin  
data class SleepNightItem(val sleepNight: SleepNight): DataItem()  
```  
  
3. The second class is `Header`, to represent a header. Since a header has no actual data, you can declare it as an `object`. That means there will only ever be one instance of `Header`. Again, have it extend `DataItem`.  
  
```kotlin  
object Header: DataItem()  
```  
  
4. Inside `DataItem`, at the class level, define an `abstract` `Long` property named `id`. When the adapter uses `DiffUtil` to determine whether and how an item has changed, the `DiffItemCallback` needs to know the id of each item. You will see an error, because `SleepNightItem` and `Header` need to override the abstract property `id`.  
  
```kotlin  
abstract val id: Long  
```  
  
5. In `SleepNightItem`, override `id` to return the `nightId`.  
  
```kotlin  
override val id = sleepNight.nightId  
```  
  
6. In `Header`, override `id` to return [`Long.MIN_VALUE`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html), which is a very, very small number (literally, -2 to the power of 63). So, this will never conflict with any `nightId` in existence.  
  
```kotlin  
override val id = Long.MIN_VALUE  
```  
  
Your finished code should look like this, and your app should build without errors.  
  
```kotlin  
sealed class DataItem {  
 abstract val id: Long  
 data class SleepNightItem(val sleepNight: SleepNight): DataItem() {  
 override val id = sleepNight.nightId  
 }  
  
 object Header: DataItem() {  
 override val id = Long.MIN_VALUE  
 }  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 2: Create a `ViewHolder` for the Header  
  
1. Create the layout for the header in a new layout resource file called **header.xml** that displays a `TextView`. There is nothing exciting about this, so here is the code.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<TextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"  
 android:id="@+id/text"  
 android:layout_width="match_parent"  
 android:layout_height="wrap_content"  
 android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge"  
 android:text="Sleep Results"  
 android:padding="8dp" />  
```  
  
2. Extract `"Sleep Results"` into a string resource and call it `header_text`.  
  
```xml  
<string name="header_text">Sleep Results</string>  
```  
  
3. In **SleepNightAdapter.kt**, inside `SleepNightAdapter`, above the `ViewHolder` class, create a new `TextViewHolder` class. This class inflates the **textview.xml** layout, and returns a `TextViewHolder` instance. Since you've done this before, here is the code, and you'll have to import `View` and `R`:  
  
```kotlin  
class TextViewHolder(view: View): RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view) {  
 companion object {  
 fun from(parent: ViewGroup): TextViewHolder {  
 val layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)  
 val view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.header, parent, false)  
 return TextViewHolder(view)  
 }  
 }  
}  
```  
  
#### Step 3: Update `SleepNightAdapter`  
  
Next you need to update the declaration of `SleepNightAdapter`. Instead of only supporting one type of `ViewHolder`, it needs to be able to use any type of view holder.  
  
##### Define the types of items  
  
1. In `SleepNightAdapter.kt`, at the top level, below the `import` statements and above `SleepNightAdapter`, define two constants for the view types.   
   
The `RecyclerView` will need to distinguish each item's view type, so that it can correctly assign a view holder to it.  
  
```kotlin  
private val ITEM_VIEW_TYPE_HEADER = 0  
private val ITEM_VIEW_TYPE_ITEM = 1  
```  
  
2. Inside the `SleepNightAdapter`, create a function to override `getItemViewType()` to return the right header or item constant depending on the type of the current item.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun getItemViewType(position: Int): Int {  
 return when (getItem(position)) {  
 is DataItem.Header -> ITEM_VIEW_TYPE_HEADER  
 is DataItem.SleepNightItem -> ITEM_VIEW_TYPE_ITEM  
 }  
 }  
```  
  
##### Update the `SleepNightAdapter` definition  
  
1. In the definition of `SleepNightAdapter`, update the first argument for the `ListAdapter` from `SleepNight` to `DataItem`.  
2. In the definition of `SleepNightAdapter`, change the second generic argument for the `ListAdapter` from `SleepNightAdapter.ViewHolder` to `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`. You will see some errors for necessary updates, and your class header should look like shown below.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter(val clickListener: SleepNightListener):       ListAdapter<DataItem, RecyclerView.ViewHolder>(SleepNightDiffCallback()) {  
```  
  
##### Update `onCreateViewHolder()`  
  
1. Change the signature of `onCreateViewHolder()` to return a `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): RecyclerView.ViewHolder  
```  
  
2. Expand the implementation of the `onCreateViewHolder()` method to test for and return the appropriate view holder for each item type. Your updated method should look like the code below.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): RecyclerView.ViewHolder {  
 return when (viewType) {  
 ITEM_VIEW_TYPE_HEADER -> TextViewHolder.from(parent)  
 ITEM_VIEW_TYPE_ITEM -> ViewHolder.from(parent)  
 else -> throw ClassCastException("Unknown viewType ${viewType}")  
 }  
 }  
```  
  
##### Update `onBindViewHolder()`  
  
1. Change the parameter type of `onBindViewHolder()` from `ViewHolder` to `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.  
  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: RecyclerView.ViewHolder, position: Int)  
```  
  
2. Add a condition to only assign data to the view holder if the holder is a `ViewHolder`.  
3. Cast the object type returned by `getItem()` to `DataItem.SleepNightItem`. Your finished `onBindViewHolder()` function should look like this.  
  
```kotlin  
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: RecyclerView.ViewHolder, position: Int) {  
 when (holder) {  
 is ViewHolder -> {  
 val nightItem = getItem(position) as DataItem.SleepNightItem  
 holder.bind(nightItem.sleepNight, clickListener)  
 }  
 }  
}  
```  
  
##### Update the `diffUtil` callbacks  
  
Change the methods in `SleepNightDiffCallback` to use your new `DataItem` class instead of the `SleepNight`. Suppress the lint warning as shown in the code below.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightDiffCallback : DiffUtil.ItemCallback<DataItem>() {  
 override fun areItemsTheSame(oldItem: DataItem, newItem: DataItem): Boolean {  
 return oldItem.id == newItem.id  
 }  
 @SuppressLint("DiffUtilEquals")  
 override fun areContentsTheSame(oldItem: DataItem, newItem: DataItem): Boolean {  
 return oldItem == newItem  
 }  
}  
```  
  
##### Add and submit the header  
  
1. Inside the `SleepNightAdapter`, below `onCreateViewHolder()`, define a function `addHeaderAndSubmitList()` as shown below. This function takes a list of `SleepNight`. Instead of using `submitList()`, provided by the `ListAdapter`, to submit your list, you will use this function to add a header and then submit the list.  
  
```kotlin  
fun addHeaderAndSubmitList(list: List<SleepNight>?) {}  
```  
  
2. Inside `addHeaderAndSubmitList()`, if the passed in list is `null`, return just a header, otherwise, attach the header to the head of the list, and then submit the list.  
  
  
```kotlin  
val items = when (list) {  
 null -> listOf(DataItem.Header)  
 else -> listOf(DataItem.Header) + list.map { DataItem.SleepNightItem(it) }  
 }  
submitList(items)  
```  
  
3. Open **SleepTrackerFragment.kt** and change the call to `submitList()` to `addHeaderAndSubmitList()`.  
  
There are two things that need to be fixed for this app. One is visible, and one is not.  
  
* The header shows up in the top-left corner, and is not easily distinguishable.  
* It doesn't matter much for a short list with one header, but you should not do list manipulation in `addHeaderAndSubmitList()` on the UI thread. Imagine a list with hundreds of items, multiple headers, and logic to decide where items need to be inserted. This work belongs in a coroutine.  
  
Change `addHeaderAndSubmitList()` to use coroutines:  
  
1. At the top level inside the `SleepNightAdapter` class, define a `CoroutineScope` with `Dispatchers.Default`.  
  
```kotlin  
private val adapterScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default)  
```  
  
2. In `addHeaderAndSubmitList()`, launch a coroutine in the `adapterScope` to manipulate the list. Then switch to the `Dispatchers.Main` context to submit the list, as shown in the code below.  
  
```kotlin  
fun addHeaderAndSubmitList(list: List<SleepNight>?) {  
 adapterScope.launch {  
 val items = when (list) {  
 null -> listOf(DataItem.Header)  
 else -> listOf(DataItem.Header) + list.map { DataItem.SleepNightItem(it) }  
 }  
 withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {  
 submitList(items)  
 }  
 }  
}  
```  
  
***  
  
### Extend the header to span across the screen  
  
Currently, the header is the same width as the other items on the grid, taking up one span horizontally and vertically. The whole grid fits three items of one span width horizontally, so the header should use three spans horizontally.  
  
To fix the header width, you need to tell the `GridLayoutManager` when to span the data across all the columns. You can do this by configuring the `SpanSizeLookup` on a `GridLayoutManager`. This is a configuration object that the `GridLayoutManager` uses to determine how many spans to use for each item in the list.  
  
1. Open **SleepTrackerFragment.kt**. Find the code where you define `manager`, towards the end of `onCreateView()`.  
  
```kotlin  
val manager = GridLayoutManager(activity, 3)  
```  
  
2. Below `manager`, define `manager.spanSizeLookup`, as shown. You need to make an `object` because `setSpanSizeLookup` doesn't take a lambda. To make an `object` in Kotlin, type _`object : classname`_, in this case `GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup`.  
  
```kotlin  
manager.spanSizeLookup = object : GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {}  
```  
  
3. You might get a compiler error to call the constructor. If you do, open the intention menu with `Option+Enter` (Mac) or `Alt+Enter` (Windows) to apply the constructor call.  
  
4. Then you'll get an error on `object` saying you need to override methods. Put the cursor on `object`, press `Option+Enter` (Mac) or `Alt+Enter` (Windows) to open the intentions menu, then override the method `getSpanSize()`.  
  
5. In the body of `getSpanSize()`, return the right span size for each position. Position 0 has a span size of 3, and the other positions have a span size of 1. Your completed code should look like the code below:  
  
```kotlin  
manager.spanSizeLookup = object : GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {  
 override fun getSpanSize(position: Int) = when (position) {  
 0 -> 3  
 else -> 1  
 }  
 }  
```  
  
6. To improve how your header looks, open **header.xml** and add this code to the layout file **header.xml**.  
  
```xml  
android:textColor="@color/white_text_color"  
android:layout_marginStart="16dp"  
android:layout_marginTop="16dp"  
android:layout_marginEnd="16dp"  
android:background="@color/colorAccent"  
```

### Summary of Adding Headers  
  
* A _header_ is generally an item that spans the width of a list and acts as a title or separator. A list can have a single header to describe the item content, or multiple headers to group items and separate items from each other.  
* A `RecyclerView` can use multiple view holders to accommodate a heterogeneous set of items; for example, headers and list items.  
* One way to add headers is to modify your adapter to use a different `ViewHolder` by checking indexes where your header needs to be shown. The `Adapter` is responsible for keeping track of the header.  
* Another way to add headers is to modify the backing dataset (the list) for your data grid, which is what you did in this lesson.  
  
These are the major steps for adding a header:  
  
* Abstract the data in your list by creating a `DataItem` that can hold a header or data.  
* Create a view holder with a layout for the header in the adapter.  
* Update the adapter and its methods to use any kind of `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.  
* In `onCreateViewHolder()`, return the correct type of view holder for the data item.  
* Update `SleepNightDiffCallback` to work with the `DataItem` class.  
* Create a `addHeaderAndSubmitList()` function that uses coroutines to add the header to the dataset and then calls `submitList()`.  
* Implement `GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup()` to make only the header three spans wide.

### Summary  
  
#### RecyclerView fundamentals  
  
* Displaying a list or grid of data is one of the most common UI tasks in Android. `RecyclerView` is designed to be efficient even when displaying extremely large lists.  
* `RecyclerView` does only the work necessary to process or draw items that are currently visible on the screen.  
* When an item scrolls off the screen, its views are recycled. That means the item is filled with new content that scrolls onto the screen.  
* The [adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) in software engineering helps an object work together with another API. `RecyclerView` uses an adapter to transform app data into something it can display, without the need for changing how the app stores and processes data.  
  
To display your data in a `RecyclerView`, you need the following parts:  
  
**RecyclerView**  
  
* To create an instance of [`RecyclerView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView), define a `<RecyclerView>` element in the layout file.  
  
**LayoutManager**  
  
A `RecyclerView` uses a `LayoutManager` to organize the layout of the items in the `RecyclerView`, such as laying them out in a grid or in a linear list.    
        
In the `<RecyclerView>` in the layout file, set the `app:layoutManager` attribute to the layout manager (such as `LinearLayoutManager` or `GridLayoutManager`).    
        
You can also set the `LayoutManager` for a `RecyclerView` programmatically. (This technique is covered in a later codelab.)    
      
**Layout for each item **  
  
Create a layout for one item of data in an XML layout file.  
  
**Adapter**  
  
Create an adapter that prepares the data and how it will be displayed in a `ViewHolder`. Associate the adapter with the `RecyclerView`.    
  
When `RecyclerView` runs, it will use the adapter to figure out how to display the data on the screen.    
  
The adapter requires you to implement the following methods:    
– `getItemCount()` to return the number of items.    
– `onCreateViewHolder()` to return the `ViewHolder` for an item in the list.    
– `onBindViewHolder()` to adapt the data to the views for an item in the list.    
  
**ViewHolder**  
  
A `ViewHolder` contains the view information for displaying one item from the item's layout.  
* The `onBindViewHolder()` method in the adapter adapts the data to the views. You always override this method. Typically, `onBindViewHolder()` inflates the layout for an item, and puts the data in the views in the layout.  
* Because the `RecyclerView` knows nothing about the data, the `Adapter` needs to inform the `RecyclerView` when that data changes. Use `notifyDataSetChanged()`to notify the `Adapter` that the data has changed.  
  
#### DiffUtil and data binding with RecyclerView  
  
**DiffUtil**:  
  
* `RecyclerView` has a class called `DiffUtil` which is for calculating the differences between two lists.  
* `DiffUtil` has a class called `ItemCallBack` that you extend in order to figure out the difference between two lists.  
* In the `ItemCallback` class, you must override the `areItemsTheSame()` and `areContentsTheSame()` methods.  
  
**ListAdapter**:  
  
* To get some list management for free, you can use the `ListAdapter` class instead of `RecyclerView.Adapter`. However, if you use `ListAdapter` you have to write your own adapter for other layouts, which is why this codelab shows you how to do it.  
* To open the intention menu in Android Studio, place the cursor on any item of code and press `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on a Mac). This menu is particularly helpful for refactoring code and creating stubs for implementing methods. The menu is context-sensitive, so you need to place cursor exactly to get the correct menu.  
  
**Data binding**:  
  
* Use data binding in the item layout to bind data to the views.  
  
**Binding adapters**:  
  
* You previously used `Transformations` to create strings from data. If you need to bind data of different or complex types, provide binding adapters to help data binding use them.  
* To declare a binding adapter, define a method that takes an item and a view, and annotate the method with `@BindingAdapter`. In Kotlin, you can write the binding adapter as an extension function on the `View`. Pass in the name of the property that the adapter adapts. For example:  
  
```xml  
@BindingAdapter("sleepDurationFormatted")  
```  
  
* In the XML layout, set an `app` property with the same name as the binding adapter. Pass in a variable with the data. For example:  
  
```xml  
.app:sleepDurationFormatted="@{sleep}"  
```  
  
#### GridLayout with RecyclerView  
  
* Layout managers manage how the items in the `RecyclerView` are arranged.  
* `RecyclerView` comes with out-of-the-box layout managers for common use cases such as `LinearLayout` for horizontal and vertical lists, and `GridLayout` for grids.  
* For more complicated use cases, implement a custom `LayoutManager`.  
* From a design perspective, `GridLayout` is best used for lists of items that can be represented as icons or images.  
* `GridLayout` arranges items in a grid of rows and columns. Assuming vertical scrolling, each item in a row takes up what's called a "span."  
* You can customize how many spans an item takes up, creating more interesting grids without the need for a custom layout manager.  
* Create an item layout for one item in the grid, and the layout manager takes care of arranging the items.  
* You can set the `LayoutManager` for the `RecyclerView` either in the XML layout file that contains the `<RecyclerView>` element, or programmatically.  
  
#### Interacting with RecyclerView items  
  
To make items in a `RecyclerView` respond to clicks, attach click listeners to list items in the `ViewHolder`, and handle clicks in the `ViewModel`.  
  
To make items in a `RecyclerView` respond to clicks, you need to do the following:  
  
* Create a listener class that takes a lambda and assigns it to an `onClick()` function.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightListener(val clickListener: (sleepId: Long) -> Unit) {  
   fun onClick(night: SleepNight) = clickListener(night.nightId)  
}  
```  
  
* Set the click listener on the view.  
  
```xml  
android:onClick="@{() -> clickListener.onClick(sleep)}"  
```  
  
* Pass the click listener to the adapter constructor, into the view holder, and add it to the binding object.  
  
```kotlin  
class SleepNightAdapter(val clickListener: SleepNightListener):  
       ListAdapter<DataItem, RecyclerView.ViewHolder>(SleepNightDiffCallback()  
```  
  
```kotlin  
holder.bind(getItem(position)!!, clickListener)  
```  
  
```kotlin  
binding.clickListener = clickListener  
```  
  
* In the fragment that shows the recycler view, where you create the adapter, define a click listener by passing a lambda to the adapter.  
  
```kotlin  
val adapter = SleepNightAdapter(SleepNightListener { nightId ->  
      sleepTrackerViewModel.onSleepNightClicked(nightId)  
})  
```  
  
* Implement the click handler in the view model. For clicks on list items, this commonly triggers navigation to a detail fragment.  
  
#### Headers in RecyclerView  
  
* A _header_ is generally an item that spans the width of a list and acts as a title or separator. A list can have a single header to describe the item content, or multiple headers to group items and separate items from each other.  
* A `RecyclerView` can use multiple view holders to accommodate a heterogeneous set of items; for example, headers and list items.  
* One way to add headers is to modify your adapter to use a different `ViewHolder` by checking indexes where your header needs to be shown. The `Adapter` is responsible for keeping track of the header.  
* Another way to add headers is to modify the backing dataset (the list) for your data grid, which is what you did in this codelab.  
  
These are the major steps for adding a header:  
  
* Abstract the data in your list by creating a `DataItem` that can hold a header or data.  
* Create a view holder with a layout for the header in the adapter.  
* Update the adapter and its methods to use any kind of `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.  
* In `onCreateViewHolder()`, return the correct type of view holder for the data item.  
* Update `SleepNightDiffCallback` to work with the `DataItem` class.  
* Create a `addHeaderAndSubmitList()` function that uses coroutines to add the header to the dataset and then calls `submitList()`.  
* Implement `GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup()` to make only the header three spans wide.
