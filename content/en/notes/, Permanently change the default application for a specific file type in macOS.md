1. **Locate the File**: Open Finder and find a file of the type you want to change (for example, a .jpg or .pdf file).
2. **Open Get Info**: Right-click (or Control-click) on the file and select **Get Info** from the context menu.
3. **Change Open With**:
    
    - In the Get Info window, look for the **Open with** section. If it’s not visible, you may need to expand it.
    - Click on the drop-down menu to see available applications. If your desired application is not listed, select **Other…** to browse for it.
    
4. **Select Your Application**: Choose the application you want to set as the default for this file type.
5. **Set as Default**: After selecting your application, click the **Change All…** button below the drop-down menu. This action will prompt a confirmation dialog asking if you want to change all similar documents to open with this application.
6. **Confirm Change**: Click **Continue** in the confirmation dialog. This will apply your selection to all files of that type.
